<h1 align="center">Hello and welcome to my GitHub page!<br/>I am Roland.</h1>

## üß† What am'I good at?

I am a software quality assurance specialist and a software engineer, with a relentless drive to business impact through testing automation, DevOps, and an entrepreneurial mindset, espacially in the vocational training sphere. 

With experience leading cross-functional QA initiatives across corporate and communities ecosystems, I bridge the gap between software quality, upskilling and reskilling people trough my QA, Programming, and Automation Engineering expertise. What your company and I are able to work on during the next months or years?

- **Architect and develop scalable test automation frameworks** using Java, Selenium, Appium, TestNG, and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).

- **Build and invest on vocational training inside [la F√©d√©ration pour l'Entrepreneuriat Durable](https://www.la-fed.org/)** - a social organization on which I am managing foundational actions, empowering workers with tailored and high level programing skills onto and for SQA, specifically.

## üõ† Here come my skills and technical stack

- **Languages & Frameworks:** `Java` ‚Ä¢ `Spring` ‚Ä¢ `Selenium` ‚Ä¢ `Appium` ‚Ä¢ `TestNG` ‚Ä¢ `Groovy` ‚Ä¢ `Python`

- **Automation & DevOps:** `Maven` ‚Ä¢`CI/CD` ‚Ä¢ `Jenkins` ‚Ä¢ `GitHub Actions` ‚Ä¢ `GitLab CI` ‚Ä¢ `Docker` ‚Ä¢ `Linux`

- **Tools & Collaboration:** `Jira` ‚Ä¢ `Xray` ‚Ä¢ `Confluence` ‚Ä¢ `Bitbucket` ‚Ä¢ `GitHub` ‚Ä¢`Git`

- **Database & Cloud:** `MySQL` ‚Ä¢ `MariaDB` ‚Ä¢ `SQL` ‚Ä¢ `Docker`

- **Methodologies & Processes:** `Agile@Scale` ‚Ä¢ `Spotify Model` ‚Ä¢ `QA Strategy` ‚Ä¢ `BDD` ‚Ä¢`TDD` ‚Ä¢ `Scrum`

## üìö My current education and engineering focus areas

1.  Building a universal QA Automation Framework to support competencies development and and Quality Assurance as a standalone professional industry.


2. Coaching QA Engineers & "developer teams" on **best practices in testing** and **how to align so they become professionally able to join the "test tribe"**.


3. **Designing micro-learning contents for upskilling and reskilling pursposes.**
